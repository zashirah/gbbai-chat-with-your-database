    "\n",
    "+ **Keyword Search**: Traditional search method relying on direct term matching. Efficient for exact matches but struggles with synonyms and context. [Learn More](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-lucene-query-architecture)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vector Search**: Converts text into high-dimensional vectors to understand semantic meaning. Finds relevant documents even without exact keyword matches. Effectiveness depends on quality of training data. [Learn More](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/vector-search-overview)\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Hybrid Search**: Combines Keyword and Vector Search for comprehensive, contextually relevant results. Effective for complex queries requiring nuanced understanding. [Learn More](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/vector-search-ranking#hybrid-search)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reranking Search**: Fine-tunes initial search results using advanced algorithms for relevance. Useful when initial retrieval returns relevant but not optimally ordered results. [Learn More](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/semantic-search-overview)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸš§ Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Keyword Search\n",
    "- **Synonym Challenges**: Struggles with recognizing synonyms or different expressions of the same concept.\n",
    "- **Context Understanding**: May not fully capture the broader context or the query's intent, especially in complex queries.\n",
    "##### Embedding-Based Search\n",
    "- **Keyword Precision**: May miss documents that contain exact terms if those terms don't semantically align with the query or document's overall content.\n",
    "- **Contextual Misinterpretations**: May overgeneralize or incorrectly interpret context, missing specific nuances.\n",
    "- **Training Data Dependency**: Performance heavily relies on the diversity and depth of the training data.\n",
    "### ðŸ’¡ Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve higher relevance out of the box: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hybrid Search**: Combines keyword and vector search methods to ensure comprehensive document retrieval across a range of queries, from highly specific to semantically complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Re-Ranking and L2 in AI Search**: Enhances initial search results by applying sophisticated ranking algorithms, improving relevance and accuracy, especially for nuanced queries."
